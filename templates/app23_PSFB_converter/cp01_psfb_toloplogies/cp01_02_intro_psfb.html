<p>
For a high-power, isolated DC-DC converter based on a
<span class="highlight">Phase-Shift Full Bridge (PSFB)</span> topology,
the primary side architecture is largely fixed, while the secondary side
offers significant flexibility. This design freedom on the secondary side
allows optimization for efficiency, current handling, and thermal performance.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Primary Side Considerations</h2>

<p>
In a PSFB converter, the primary side topology is well established and
changes very little between designs:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Full-bridge configuration using four power switches</li>
    <li>Control via phase-shift between the two bridge legs</li>
    <li>Nearly constant switching frequency</li>
    <li>Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) achieved using transformer leakage inductance and device output capacitances</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although component choices may vary (Si or SiC MOSFETs, gate drivers,
snubber networks), these variations do not alter the fundamental behavior
of the primary side. As a result, optimization efforts are mainly focused
on the secondary side.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Secondary Side Design Flexibility</h2>

<p>
The secondary side topology can be selected based on application-specific
requirements such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Output voltage level</li>
    <li>Output current magnitude</li>
    <li>Efficiency targets</li>
    <li>Cost constraints</li>
    <li>Design complexity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Secondary Options</h3>

<h4>Diode Rectification</h4>
<p>
Simple diode-based rectification (center-tap or bridge) is generally unsuitable
for low-voltage, high-current applications. At 12&nbsp;V and currents above
200&nbsp;A, conduction losses become excessive, making this option impractical
for automotive use.
</p>

<h4>Synchronous Rectification</h4>
<p>
Replacing diodes with MOSFETs significantly reduces conduction losses and is
widely used in low-voltage converters. This approach is common and often serves
as the foundation for more advanced secondary structures.
</p>

<h4 class="highlight">Current Doubler Rectifier</h4>
<p>
The current doubler topology builds on synchronous rectification and introduces
two output inductors to split the load current between two paths. This structure
offers several key advantages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lower output current ripple</li>
    <li>Reduced RMS current in each inductor and MOSFET</li>
    <li>Lower conduction and thermal stress on secondary-side components</li>
    <li>Improved efficiency at very high output currents</li>
</ul>

<p>
These characteristics make the current doubler particularly well suited for
<span class="highlight">12&nbsp;V outputs at power levels around 3&nbsp;kW
and above</span>, where output currents exceed 200&nbsp;A.
</p>

<h4>Active Secondary Bridge</h4>
<p>
Fully active secondary bridges (similar to a dual-active-bridge structure)
increase control flexibility but add significant complexity and cost. For a
unidirectional 12&nbsp;V automotive DC-DC converter, this solution is rarely
justified.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Transformer Considerations</h2>

<p>
Although the primary topology remains fixed, the transformer design is closely
linked to the chosen secondary structure. Parameters such as turns ratio,
leakage inductance, magnetizing inductance, and winding arrangement are
optimized to support the current doubler operation and ensure high efficiency
and reliable ZVS behavior.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
For a high-power automotive DC-DC converter with a 12&nbsp;V output:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The PSFB primary side is a mature and largely fixed solution</li>
    <li>The secondary side provides the main opportunity for optimization</li>
    <li>The current doubler topology offers the best balance of efficiency,
        current handling, and thermal performance</li>
</ul>

<p class="highlight">
As a result, the combination of a PSFB primary with synchronous rectification
and a current doubler secondary is a well-established and proven choice in
automotive applications.
