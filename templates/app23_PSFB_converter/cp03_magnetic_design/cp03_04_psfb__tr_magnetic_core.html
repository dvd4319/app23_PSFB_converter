    <h2>Chosen Core: E38/8/25 Planar E-core</h2>
    
    <p class="highlight"><strong>Why E38/8/25?</strong><br>
    The transformer uses planar technology with multilayer PCB windings to achieve high power density, reduced volume, and good thermal performance compared to conventional wire-wound designs. Core selection in planar magnetics is driven by two key parameters: effective core cross-sectional area (Ae) – which determines Bpk and core losses – and winding window width/area – which limits conductor cross-section per turn and directly affects DC and AC winding losses at high output current (up to 230 A total).</p>

    <p>A larger window width enables wider PCB tracks, lowering resistance and proximity/skin effect losses on the high-current secondary. The goal is to minimize total losses (core + windings) while keeping Bpk practical (90–130 mT target at 200 kHz) and achieving Lp = 100 µH. E38/8/25 was chosen over E43/10/28 and the other evaluated cores primarily due to its availability in stock and superior compactness (≈9 cm³ volume), which was critical for integration in space-constrained 1.6 kW modules. This came with a trade-off in Ae and window width, compensated by the low-loss material 3C96 and careful PCB optimization (wide copper layers, interleaving).</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion on core:</strong> E38/8/25 was selected for its superior power density and compact size (≈9 cm³), making it ideal for integration in 1.6 kW modules with limited space and strict weight requirements. It provides acceptable Ae (194 mm²) for Bpk in the 100–130 mT range when paired with a very low-loss material like 3C96, and the narrower window (≈10–12 mm) is managed through careful PCB track design (wide copper layers, interleaving). Larger cores such as E43/10/28 offer better winding loss performance or lower core losses, but were not chosen due to unavailability in stock at the time of prototyping and the unacceptable increase in volume/density trade-off for this application. The choice prioritizes compactness, availability, and practical integration while relying on 3C96 to keep core losses under control.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> 3C96 on E38/8/25 minimizes core losses within the available materials (lowest Pv at 200 kHz/high flux and 100 °C), supports Lp = 100 µH and ZVS, avoids saturation at Vin max, and targets the efficiency goal. Pragmatic choice based on Ferroxcube data, constrained by available stock, and focused on compact module design.</p>
