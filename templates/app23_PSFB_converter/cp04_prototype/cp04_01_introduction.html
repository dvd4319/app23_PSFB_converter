To enable the practical implementation of the converter application, the power-stage electrical schematic must be complemented with several auxiliary functional blocks, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A microcontroller (μC);</li>
    <li>A voltage regulation unit;</li>
    <li>Dedicated protection circuits;</li>
    <li>Gate-driving circuits for semiconductor devices;</li>
    <li>A communication interface module;</li>
    <li>Input and output filtering stages.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These components are essential for ensuring reliable converter operation, facilitating communication with external systems, and providing protection against fault conditions such as output short circuits, overloads, overvoltage, and excessive temperature. The protection mechanisms play a critical role in mitigating potentially hazardous situations caused by internal or external failures of the converter, which could otherwise result in vehicle immobilization during operation or pose safety risks to passengers.
