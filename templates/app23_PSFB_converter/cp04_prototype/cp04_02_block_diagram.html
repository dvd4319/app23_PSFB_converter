        <strong>Block Diagram:</strong> The converter’s block diagram, including the two DC-DC modules connected in parallel along with the additional functional blocks, is shown in Fig. 6.1.

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Voltage Regulator:</strong> Provides a stable supply voltage to the microcontroller, driver circuits, and protection circuits.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Protection Circuits:</strong> Protect both the converter and the connected electrical network from overvoltage, overcurrent, and excessive temperature. In the event of a major fault, they immediately stop converter operation and communicate the fault status to the vehicle’s ECU (Electronic Control Unit).
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Driver Circuits:</strong> Necessary because the microcontroller cannot directly control power semiconductor devices. Drivers provide sufficient current to reliably operate these devices.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Input/Output Filters:</strong> Suppress noise generated by the switching of power devices and prevent external transient signals from interfering with converter operation, ensuring electromagnetic compatibility.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Microcontroller:</strong> Generates all control signals for the power switches, regulates output voltage, balances the currents between the parallel DC-DC modules, and manages communication. A high-performance DSP microcontroller (TMS320F28069) was selected. The author designed the module, created the schematic, and partially developed the software for internal module configuration and peak-current control strategy implementation. The communication protocol and graphical interface were developed externally.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Communication Module:</strong> Transmits converter status and measured parameters (voltages, currents), allowing external control. This enables the converter to be diagnosed, started, or stopped remotely by the vehicle’s ECU.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Current Sensor:</strong> Measures the total current supplied by the converter to the 12V network and enables additional short-circuit and overload protection via the microcontroller software.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Traction Battery:</strong> Serves as the main input voltage source for the converter, with high capacity to supply energy to both the converter and the vehicle’s electric propulsion motors.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>12V Auxiliary Battery:</strong> Connected in parallel with the DC-DC converter output to power the vehicle’s low-voltage system. It supplies critical loads such as the ECU, lighting, and power steering, as well as non-critical consumers like the media system, electric windows, and heating.
    </li>
